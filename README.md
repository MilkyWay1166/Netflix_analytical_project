# CONCLUSION

Regarding the insights explored, non-Asian countries in the top 10 exhibit a preference for film production over TV, with a primary focus on adult audiences.

By contrast, Asian leaders such as South Korea and Japan concentrate on TV series aimed at teenagers.

India, however, shows a notable exception; it maintains a film-heavy output (90%) while simultaneously targeting a younger segment, indicating a mix of Asian and non-Asian characteristics.

Despite these regional differences above, there is a global trend toward utilizing international themes, drama, and comedy in scriptwriting.
